# Handwritten-digit-Recognition-through-Machine-Learning

I did a project to classify handwritten digits using machine learning in Python, almost an year back. I used Pythonâ€™s Scikit Learn library, along with Pandas, and Numpy on an open data set, to read and classify handwritten digits.

I used K Nearest neighbors and Decision Trees, and GridSearchCV to achieve an accuracy of 92.5%. The process that I followed, along with the code, is in the .pynb file.
